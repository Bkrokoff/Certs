    <h2> WAN Termination</h2>
    
    <p>
        If you are using services from a WAN provider or ISP, there needs to be a physical location that designates the connection point between the providers network and your internal network (Demarcation Point)
    </p>

    <h3>Demarcation Point</h3>

    <p>
        The point where you connect to the outside world <br>
        WAN provider <br>
        Internet Service Provider <br>
        The demarc <br><br>

        The demarcation point is used everywhere <br>
        Could be connected to your home <br><br>

        It is in a central location when in buildings <br>
        Usually a network interface device <br>
        Can be as simple as an RJ-45 connection <br><br>

        The location of a demarc is important - especially when problems occurring <br>
        You can understand whether the problem is on the provider side or your side of the demarc <br><br>

        Usually if the problem is on your side, you have your own equipment and your own routers on your own premises <br><br>

        This is referred to as CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) <br><br>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Smartjack</h3>

    <p>
        Providers will put specialized equipment in your demarc room that they are able to control remotely - smartjack <br><br>

        Technically it is a NIU (Network INterface Unit) <br><br>

        This is a powered system that is monitoring and is able to provide diagnostics remotely, so the provider can connect to the smartjack, run their own tests, and determine if the problems are occuring on the providers side or your side of the network <br><br>
