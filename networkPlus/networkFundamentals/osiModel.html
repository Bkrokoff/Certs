    <h2> OSI Model </h2> 

    <h3> What is the OSI Model? </h3>
    <p>
        - Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model <br>
        &emsp; - It is a way to describe the way internet traffic is moving from one part of the network to another <br><br>

        - It's a guide (thus the term "model") <br>
        &emsp; - Don't get wrapped up in the details <br><br>

        - This is not the OSI Protocol Suite <br>
        &emsp; - Most of the OSI protocols didn't catch on <br><br>

        - There are unique protocols at every layer <br><br>

        - You'll refer to this model for the rest of your career <br>
        &emsp; - often <br><br>

        - <b>A</b>ll (Application) - Layer 7 <br>
        - <b>P</b>eople (Presentation) - Layer 6<br>
        - <b>S</b>eem (Session) - Layer 5<br>
        - <b>T</b>o (Transport) - Layer 4<br>
        - <b>N</b>eed (Network) - Layer 3<br>
        - <b>D</b>ata (Data Link) - Layer 2<br>
        - <b>P</b>rocessing (Physical) - Layer 1<br>

    </p>

    <h3> Layer 1 - Physical Layer </h3>
    <p>
        - The physics of the network <br>
        &emsp; - Signaling, cabling, connectors <br>
        &emsp; - This layer is NOT about protocols <br><br>

        - "You have a physical layer problem" <br>
        &emsp; - Fix your cabling, <a href="/glossary.html#P">punch-downs</a>, etc <br>
        &emsp; - Run <a href="/glossary.html#L">loopback tests</a>, test/replace cables, swap adapter cards <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3> Layer 2 - Data Link </h3>
    <p>
        - The basic network "language" <br>
        &emsp; - The foundation of communications at the data link layer<br><br>

        - Sometimes called the Data Link Control (DLC) protocols <br>
        &emsp; - Example of a DLC protocol: <a href="/macAddress.html">MAC</a>(Media Access Control) address on Ethernet <br><br>

        - Sometimes called the "Switching" Layer <br> 
    </p>

    <img src="./images/DataLinkExample.PNG" height="200px" width="500px">

    <p>
        - Any communication taking place between these two <a href="/glossary.html#N">NIC's</a> (Network Interface Cards) using those MAC Addresses is referred to as a layer 2 communication <br>
    </p>

    <h3> Layer 3 - Network Layer </h3>

    <p>
        - Sometimes called the "Routing" Layer <br><br>

        - Internet Protocol (IP) - Any device making forwarding decisions based on IP addresses is communicating at layer 3 <br><br>

        - Fragments frames to traverse different networks <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3> Layer 4 - Transport Layer </h3>
    
    <p>
        - Sometimes called the "Post Office" Layer <br>
        &emsp; - Parcels and Letters <br>
        &emsp; - Describes how data is being delivered and where data is being delivered into a system <br><br>

        - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Diagram Protocol) <br><br>

        - This layer is used when you are accessing a webpage, but the website is so large that data cannot be sent across the network in a single frame <br> 
        - Instead it is split up into separate frames and sent across the network and then put back together when it reaches the other side <br>
    </p>

    <h3> Layer 5 - Session Layer </h3>

    <p>
        - Communication management between devices <br>
        &emsp; - Start, Stop, Restart <br><br>

        - Control protocols, tunneling protocols used to begin the communication of data between one device and another <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3> Layer 6 - Presentation Layer </h3>
    
    <p>
        - Character Encoding <br><br>

        - Application Encryption <br><br>

        - Takes the data and puts it into a form that we can understand <br><br>

        - Often combined with application layer <br>
        &emsp; - The functionality is closely associated with our ability to use these applications <br><br> 
    </p>

    <h3> Layer 7 - Application Layer </h3>
    
    <p>
        - The layer we see <br><br>

        - HTTP, FTP, DNS, POP3 <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3> Real World Example </h3>
    <p>
        - Application - HTTP, FTP, SMTP <br>
        - Presentation - Application Encryption (SSL/TLS) <br>
        - Session - Controls protocols, tunneling protocols, Authentication/Authorization <br>
        - Transport - TCP segment, UDP segment <br>
        - Network - IP Address, Router, Packet <br>
        - Data Link - Frame, MAC address, Extended Unique Identifier (EUI-48, EUI-64), Switch <br>
        - Physical - Cables, fiber, the signal itself, hub, network cabling, and repeater <br><br>

        - <a href="https://youtu.be/owDh6FNJUog?t=491"> Example with wireshark </a>

    <h3> PDU Units</h3>
    <p>
        - Application - Data<br>
        - Presentation - Data<br>
        - Session - Data<br>
        - Transport - Segment<br>
        - Network - Packet<br>
        - Data Link - Frame<br>
        - Physical - Bit<br>
    </p>

    <h3>Follow the Conversation</h3>
    <p>
        - Application: https://mail.google.com <br>
        - Presentation: SSL encryption <br>
        - Session: Link the presentation to transport <br>
        - Transport: TCP encapsulation <br>
        - Network: IP encapsulation <br>
        - Data Link: Ethernet <br>
        - Physical: Electrical Signals <br>

    <h3> Real World Example 2</h3>
    <h4> Sending Steps </h4>
    <p>
        Step 1. Application Layer - Gets ready to send email using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) <br>
        Step 2. Presentation Layer - Data is formatted in a way the receiving device will understand (ASCII) <br>
        Step 3. Session Layer - Session for receiving mail server is started <br>
        Step 4. Transport - Decides to use TCP or UDP to make sure every packet is delivered | Source and destination port added to data <br>
        Step 5. Network - IP address of the mail server is added as the destination | Source IP address is also added to the data <br>
        Step 6. Data - The MAC address of the router and the source MAC address of the host is added to the data <br>
        Step 7. Physical - The data is sent out on the network using ethernet <br>
    </p>

    <h4> Receiving Steps </h4>
    <p>
        Steps from above are done in reverse, starting from the bottom up <br> 
    </p>

    <h3> Troubleshooting </h3>
    <p>
        Layer 1 (Physical) - Are all the cables plugged in | Is the network card functioning | Faulty Cable  <br>
        Layer 2 (Data) - Maybe a switch has gone bad <br>
        Layer 3 (Network) - Is the router functioning | Do I have the right IP address <br>
        Process continues from there... 
    </p>
