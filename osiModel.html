    <h2> OSI Model </h2> 

    <h3> 7. Application </h3>
    <p>
        SMTP, FTP, Telnet <br>
    </p>  

    <h3> 6. Presentation </h3>
    <p>
        Format Data, Encryption <br>
    </p>  

    <h3> 5. Session </h3>
    <p>
        Start & Stop Sessions <br>
    </p>  

    <h3> 4. Transport </h3>
    <p>
        TCP (error handling & sequencing to ensure data is not lost), UDP, Port Numbers <br>
    </p>  

    <h3> 3. Network </h3>
    <p>
        IP Address, Routers <br>
    </p>  

    <h3> 2. Data Link </h3>
    <p>
        MAC Address, switches <br>        
    </p> 

    <h3> 1. Physical </h3>
    <p>
        Cable, Network Interface Cards, Hubs <br>
        Carries data across physical hardware <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        All People Seem To Need Data Processing <br>
    </p>

    <h3> Real World Example </h3>
    <h4> Sending Steps </h4>
    <p>
        Step 1. Application Layer - Gets ready to send email using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) <br>
        Step 2. Presentation Layer - Data is formatted in a way the receiving device will understand (ASCII) <br>
        Step 3. Session Layer - Session for receiving mail server is started <br>
        Step 4. Transport - Decides to use TCP or UDP to make sure every packet is delivered | Source and destination port added to data <br>
        Step 5. Network - IP address of the mail server is added as the destination | Source IP address is also added to the data <br>
        Step 6. Data - The MAC address of the router and the source MAC address of the host is added to the data <br>
        Step 7. Physical - The data is sent out on the network using ethernet <br>
    </p>

    <h4> Receiving Steps </h4>
    <p>
        Steps from above are done in reverse, starting from the bottom up <br> 
    </p>

    <h3> Troubleshooting </h3>
    <p>
        Layer 1 (Physical) - Are all the cables plugged in | Is the network card functioning | Faulty Cable  <br>
        Layer 2 (Data) - Maybe a switch has gone bad <br>
        Layer 3 (Network) - Is the router functioning | Do I have the right IP address <br>
        Process continues from there...
