    <h2> Laptop Hardware </h2>
    <h3> Laptop Batteries </h3>
    <p>
        The power source when unplugged <br>
        May be easily replaced or require a teardown <br>
        Five minutes vs one hour <br><br>

        Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) and Lithium-Ion polymer (LiPo are common) <br>
        No "memory effect" <br>
        Charging the battery diminishes capcity <br><br>

        Different form factor for each laptop <br>
        Battery types and styles can vary <br>
        Battery technology is changing constantly <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3> Laptop Keyboard </h3>
    <p>
        The most-used component of the laptop <br>
        Can be easy to replace <br>
        A few screws and a single ribbon cable <br>
        May not always be this simple <br><br>

        Connect an external USB keyboard <br>
        Not very portable, but works in a pinch <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3> Laptop Keys </h3>
    <p>
        Some repairs might require the removal or replacement of a key cap <br>
        This can be a delicate procedure <br><br>

        Check with the manufacturer's instructions <br>
        It's very easy to accidentally break the key cap or the components underneath <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3> Laptop Memory </h3>
    <p>
        Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module (SO-DIMM) <br><br>
        
        Memory used in laptops and mobile devices <br>
        Often easy to install and replace <br><br>

        Some laptop memory is soldered to the system board <br>
        No upgrade available <br>
        Requires a full system board replacement <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3> Laptop Storage </h3>
    <p>
        Magnetic Disk <br>
        Traditional spinning drive platters <br>
        2.5 form factors (3.5 inch for desktops) <br><br>

        SSD (Solid-state drive) <br>
        All memory, no moving parts <br>
        Silent, fast access time, less latency <br>
        2.5 inch form factors <br><br>

        M.2 <br>
        Smaller form factor <br>
        No SATA data or power cables <br>
        Easy to install and replace <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3> Replacing Laptop Storage </h3>
    <p>
        All internal <br>
        Open a cover on the back <br>
        Open the entire laptop <br><br>

        Can be very modular (Moddable) <br>
        Two screws and the drive slides out <br><br>

        M.2 drives are even easier <br>
        One screw <br>
        Similar to RAM installation <br><br>
