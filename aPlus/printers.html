    <h2> Printers</h2>
    <p>
      Printers allows the ability to print documents or pictures onto paper from a computer <br>
      The most common way a computer connects to a priter is by using a USB or parallel cable (local connection) <br>
      You can also connect a printer through a network <br> 
      Network printers connect using an ethernet port or a wireless connection (network printers) <br><br>

      A NETWORK SHARE allows other computers on your network to connect using your local printer (sharing printer) <br>
      Your computer works as a gateway for other computers to connect <br>
      The computer that has the local connection to the printer must be turned on for other computers to use it <br> 
    </p>

    <h2> Types of Printers</h2>

    <h3> Non-impact Printers </h3>
    <p>
        Print without striking an ink ribbon onto paper <br>
        Example: Laser, Inkjet, and Thermal Printers <br>
    </p>

    <h3> Impact Printers </h3>
    <p>
        Dot Matrix Printers
    </p>

    <h3> Inkjet Printers </h3>
    <p>
        The most common printers that are used for home use <br>
        Print head moves back and forth across the paper during printing <br>
        Print head places ink on the paper in very tiny dots (Dots are so tiny they are smaller in diameter than a human hair) <br><br>

        Typically come with 2 ink cartiridges (1 for color, 1 for black) <br>
        More affordable than laser printers and produce photo quality results <br>
        Drawback: Ink may smudge, while ink from a laser printer does not smudge <br>
    </p>

    <h3> Laser Printer </h3>
    <p>
        Laser printers come in different sizes <br>
        From small personal ones, to larger ones for businesses <br>
        Provide the highest quality print available <br>
        Most expensive printers <br><br>

        Basic operation: <br>
        Electric charge is placed on a rotating drum <br>
        Laser discharges a lower electrical charge on the drum <br>
        Laser draws the image that is going to be printed on the drum itself <br>
        Drum is then coated with a fine black powder, known as toner <br>
        Toner only clings to the areas where the laser has drawn <br>
        Toner is then placed on the paper, leading to a high quality print <br>

    </p>

    <h3> Thermal Printer </h3>
    <p>
        Prints by using heat and uses a special paper called thermal paper <br>
        Thermal paper has wax based ink <br>
        As heat is applied to the ink, it turns black <br>
        Print head applies heat to the areas where the ink should be placed, when the ink is cooled it becomes permanent <br>
        Thermal printers are very quiet and are commonly used for printing labels and barcodes <br>
    </p>

    <h3> Dot Matrix Printer </h3>
    <p>
        An old technology that produces mediocre print quality compared to inkjet and laser <br>
        They are also very noisy <br>
        The pins on the print head strike against a cloth ink ribbon that comes in direct contact with the paper <br>
        Characters are in the form of dots <br>
        Very durable and last a long time <br>
    </p>

    <h2> Printer Issues </h2>
    <p>
        Streaks: Caused by inkjet cartridges <br>
        To fix: Use printer software tools to clean print head<br>
        Manually clean cartridges with a lint free cloth <br><br>

        Faded / Blank Image: Dirty ink cartidges or low on ink (Inkjet) <br>
        To fix: Replace ink cartridges <br><br>

        Ghosting: Faint image of a previous paint job (Laser printer) <br>
        Caused by: The drum - Drum in a laser printer has set lifespan after too many prints OR The Fuser<br> 
        To fix: Replace them <br><br>

        Paper Jam: Could be caused by debris inside the printer <br>
        Debris could also cause paper to crease <br>
        Could be caused by faulty printer rollers <br>
        To fix: Replace rollers or clear debris <br><br>

        Color not printing correctly: Faulty color ink cartridge or low/out of colored ink <br>
        To fix: Replace cartridge <br><br>

        Nothing happens when you print: Could be caused by connectivity issue <br>
        Especially common with network printers <br>
        To fix: Check the obvious first - Printer is on | Check for errors on LCD display | Make sure network cable is plugged in (network printer) <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3> Virtual printing </h3>
    <p>
        Instead of printing to paper you can print into a digital form on your computer or another computer <br><br>

        Print to file - allows you to print something in a printer file format (pm) so that you may use that file on another computer when you have access to a printer (Uneditable) <br>
        Print to PDF - Prints a document into a format that is readable across all devices (PDF) | Just about every new device on the market will be able to read a PDF <br>
        Older devices may need a pdf reader to read PDF's. The most common is Adobe Acrobat Reader (available to download for free) <br>
