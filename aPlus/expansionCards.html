    <h2> Adapter / Expansion Cards</h2>
    <p>
        Circuit boards that can be installed into the expanion slots of the motherboard <br>
        Adapter card are designed to increase the functionality of the computer <br>
        For example: Video cards, audio cards, storage cards, etc <br>
    </p>

    <h2> Video Card </h2>
    <p>
        Generates images from the computer to the monitor <br>
        Also known as graphics card, graphics adapters, etc <br>
        Has several components: GPU, Memory, Bus Type, and video ports <br>
        Video is transferred to the monitor through the video ports <br><br>
    </p>

    <h3> Video Ports </h3>
    <p>
        S-video(Separate Video or Super Video) is an analog transmitter <br>
        Transmits 2 signals over one cable - Color and brightness <br>
        Round port - black color <br><br>

        VGA (Video Graphics Array) <br>
        Older technology - developed in 1987 <br>
        Has 15 pins - divided into 3 rows <br>
        Blue color <br>
        Carries analog data <br><br>

        DVI (Digital Visual Interface) <br>
        Newer technology designed to succeed the VGA port <br>
        Developed in 1999 <br>
        Desiged to deliver uncompressed high quality video to LCD monitors <br>
        DVI-A - Used to send analog signals only | DVI-D - Used to send digital signals only | DVI-I - Used to send both analog and digital signals<br><br>

        HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) <br>
        Developed in 2002 <br>
        Designed to deliver uncompessed video and audio data through a single cable <br><br>

        Display Port <br>
        Debuted in 2006 <br>
        Developed by VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) <br>
        Primarily used for video, but can also be used to carry USB and audio data as well <br><br>
    </p>

    <h2> Sound Card </h2>
    <p>
        Processes audio through the computers speakers <br>
        Has an audio (green) output port for attaching speakers <br>

    </p>

    <h2> USB card </h2>
    <p>
        Adapter card with USB ports <br>
        Adds or expands USB capability to a computer <br>
    </p>

    <h2> RAID Card </h2>
    <p>
        Adapter card for creating a hardware RAID array <br>
        RAID is used for data redundancy <br>
        In a hardware RAID setup, the operating system is not aware of RAID implementation <br>
    </p>

    <h2> eSATA card </h2>
    <p>
