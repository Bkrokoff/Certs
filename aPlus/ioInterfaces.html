    <h2> I/O Interfaces (Motherboard)</h2>
    <p>
        Input / Output Panel: <br><br>

        The PS/2 is a 6pin - multi-din connector <br>
        Green PS/2: Used for plugging in the mouse <br>
        Purple PS/2: Used for plugging in the keyboard <br><br>

        USB stands for universal serial bus <br>
        Motherboards will typically have several USB ports <br>
        Also supplies electric power to that specific peripheral <br>
        USB versions: USB 1.0 - 1.5 Mb/s | USB 1.1 - 12 Mb/s | USB 2.0 - 480 Mb/s | USB 3.0 - 5 Gb/s <br><br>
        
        The Serial Port <br>
        An older technology rarely seen on motherboards today <br>
        Mainly used for connecting terminals and modems <br>
        The most common interface of a serial port is the RS-232 standard <br><br>

        The Parallel Port <br>
        Mainly used for connecting printers <br>
        Being phased out and replaced by the faster USB port <br>
        Uses a wide D-Sub connector known as the DB-25 <br><br>

        The video port <br>
        Motherboards that do have a video adapter is known as integrated video <br>
        Generates images from your computer to your monitor <br>
        The most common kind of port on an integrated video adapter is VGA (Video Graphics Array) <br>
        The VGA port carries analog data. It has 15 pins divided into 3 rows and usually has a blue color <br>
        Integrated video adapters are usually not very powerful <br><br>

        The IEEE connector is commonly known as Firewire <br>
        Recognized by its "D" shape <br>
        Commonly used by attaching cameras or prinders <br>
        Transfer speed of 400  mb/s <br><br>

        The Network Interface Card (NIC) is used for netowrking purposes <br>
        Designed for an ethernet cable with a RJ-45 connector <br>
        Has its own unique identifier called a MAC address <br><br>

        The sound card <br>
        Processes audio through the computers speakers <br>
        Basic sound card will have a port for speakers (green | middle input) and a port for a microhpone (pink | bottom input) <br><br>

        The eSATA port is for attaching external <a href="./glossary.html">SATA</a> drives <br>
        Functions similar to USB and Firewire ports <br>
        Transfer speeds are faster, but require a separate power plug <br>
        The eSATAp port combines data transfer and power in an all-in-one port <br><br>
