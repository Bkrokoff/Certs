    <h2> BIOS / CMOS </h2>
    <h3> BIOS (Basic Input Output System) </h3>
    <p>
        The BIOS is software that is built into the motherboard that initializes the computers peripherals <br>
        Such as the keyboard, mouse, video card, optical drives, etc <br>
        After initialization, it then searches for a boot device (OS) <br><br>

        The BIOS software is stored on the BIOS chip on the motherboard <br>
        The BIOS chip is non-volatile <br>
        Popular vendors of BIOS chips are American Megatrends and Pheonix Technologies <br>
    </p>

    <h3> CMOS Battery </h3>
    <p>
        Computers need to maintain certain settings (date & time, hardware settings) that are stored on the CMOS chip <br>
        The CMOS (Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) battery maintains these settings <br>
        A small button cell battery located on the motherboard <br>
    </p>

    <h3> Boot Priority </h3>
    <p>
        When you turn on a computer, the computer does a POST - Power On Self Test - to ensure that everything is working <br>
        After POST has passed, the BIOS searches for something to boot from (OS) <br>
        You can change the boot priority in CMOS in any order you want <br>
        After you make the change, you must save the settings and the settings will take affect after the computer is rebooted <br>
    </p>

    <h3> BIOS </h3>
    <p>
        You can set the date and time in BIOS <br>
        You can also enable or disable certain devices in the BIOS <br>
        Allows you to modify the CPU clock speed <br>
        You can monitor the temperature of the CPU with the BIOS <br>
        Virtualization can be enabled or disabled in the BIOS <br>
        A BIOS password protects against unauthorized users <br>
        Prevents changes to the BIOS and from the computer booting <br>
    </p>

    <h3> POST (Power on Self Test) </h3>
    <p>
        The POST tests the computer to make sure all the requirements are met and the hardware is working correctly <br>
        If the computer passes the test, it will make a short single "beep" <br>
        No beep or multiple beeps, indicates a problem <br>
        The computer will generate a beep code to help you pinpoint the problem <br>
        Refer to the manufacturers documentation to find a list of beep codes <br>
    </p>

    <h3> BIOS </h3>
    <p>
        Some BIOS systems detect if the computer case has been opened <br><br>

        LoJack - Service that can locate your computer if it has been stolen <br>
    </p>

    <h3> UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) </h3>
    <p>
        UEFI (NEW) <br>
        More modern BIOS <br>
        User friendly, graphical user interface <br>
        Recognizes larger storage devices <br>
        Able to use a mouse in the interface <br><br>

        BIOS (OLD) <br>
        Blue screen that resembles the BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) <br>
        Cannot recognize larger storage drives <br>
        Only able to use a keyboard <br><br>

        Secure Boot - built in new feature in UEFI that stops any digitally unsigned drivers from loading and helps to stop malicious software such as rootkits <br>
