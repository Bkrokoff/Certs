    <h2> Storage Devices </h2>
    <p>
        A computer has two types of memory - Primary and Secondary <br>
        Secondary memory is permanent which is the hard disk drive <br>
    </p>

    <h2> Hard Drive (Magnetic)</h2>
    <p>
        A sealed case that contains magnetic disks where the data is stored on <br>
        The disk rotates at high speeds and the actuator either writes data to the disk or reads data from them (Looks similar to record player) <br>
        The disk rotates at either 5400 - 7200 - 10000 RPM <br>
        Typical desktop hard drive would operate at 7200 RPM <br>
        Cheaper hard srives would operate at 5400 RPM - typical for laptops <br>
        Hard drives are non volatile because they can retain and store data when not connected to a power source <br>
    </p>

    <h2> SATA Hard Drive </h2>
    <p>
        Hard drives today uses the Serial ATA interface <br>
        A newer standard thats faster than the old Parallel ATA <br>
        Instead of data travelling in a parallel path, it now travels in a serial path with a SATA cable (Travels 1 bit at a time) <br>
        SATA - Transfer speeds average 6 GB/s <br>
        Hot swappable and smaller cables <br> 
    </p>

    <h2> Solid State Drives (SSD) </h2>
    <p>
        Has no moving parts and uses flash memory chips to store data <br>
        Since it has no moving parts, data transfer is very fast <br>
    </p>

    <h2> Hybrid Drive (Magnetic and SSD) </h2>
    <p>
        Combines the use of magnetic disks and flash memory <br>
        Takes advantage of the large capacity and low cost of magnetic disks, with the speed of an SSD <br>
        Magnetic disks will be used to store data, while the flash memory would be used for the caching of the data <br>
        Used when cost is an issue, because SSD Drives are more expensive than magnetic disks <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Removeable Storage</h2>
    <h2> Tape Drives </h2>
    <p>
        An inexpensive way to back up data from your hard drive <br>
        It attaches to a computer, usually with a USB cable <br>
        Data is backed up sequentially to tape <br>
        To restore data, you have to restore data in the same order as you backed them up <br>     
    </p>

    <h2> CD-ROM Drives </h2>
    <p> 
        Has become a standard component in computers today <br>
        Reads data from a CD-ROM which is a disk that stores permanent data <br>
        CD-Rom stands for compact disk read only memory, which means that the data can only be read and cannot be changed or written to <br> 
    </p>

    <h2> CD-RW Drive </h2>
    <p>
        CD-RW drive can change or write data to a CD <br>
        Has a moving laser assembly that writes or "burns" the data onto the CD <br>
        CD-R: can only be written once<br>
        CD-RW: allows data to be rewritten multiple times<br>
        A CD can hold 700 MB of data <br>
    </p>

    <h2> DVD-ROM Drive </h2>
    <p>
        DVD-ROM drive is a device that reads DVD disks <br>
        Has largely replaced ordinary CD-ROM drives beacuse of large storage capacity of DVD disks <br>
        DVD can store approx. 4.7 GB of data <br>
    </p>

    <h2> DVD-RW Drive </h2>
    <p>
        DVD-RW drive can change or write data to a DVD <br>
        Writes data on to DVD-R disks and rewrites data onto DVD-RW disks <br>
        Dual layer DVD-RW drives can burn dual layer DVDs <br>
        Dual layer DVDs have 2 recordable layers <br>
        Dual layer DVDs can hold approx 8.5 GB of data <br>
    </p>

    <h2> Blu-Ray Drive </h2>
    <p>
        The latest optical drive to date that released in 2006 <br>
        Will eventually replace the DVD format because of its high capacity <br>
        Blu-Ray disc can hold 25 GB of data, which is 5 times more than a DVD <br>
    </p>

    <h2> BD-R & BD-RE Drive (Blu-Ray)</h2>
    <p>
        BD-R drive burns data to a blu-ray disc one time <br>
        BD-RE drive can erase data and overwite data on a blu ray disc <br>
        Dual layer BD-Rs can hold 50 GB of data <br>
    </p>

    <h2> Thumb Drive </h2>
    <p>
        Uses memory chips to store data <br>
        Miniature storage device with a USB interface <br>
        Can store anywhere from 500 MB to 256 GB <br>
        Fast and convenitent data storage <br>
    </p>

    <h2> SD Card </h2>
    <p>
        Secure digital cards are a popular type of flash memory <br>
        Primarily used in digital cameras for storing photographs and videos <br>
        Come in various capacities, anywhere from 2 GB - 512 GB <br>
        Need an SD card reader to be read on the computer <br>
    </p>

    <h2> Storage Cards </h2>
    <p>
        Other types of SD cards include the mini SD and the micro SD <br>
        The micro SD card is what is commonly used in most smart phones for adding extra storage <br>
        Another type of flash drive used in a lot of DSLR cameras is compact flash <br>
        Provides quick and easy storage for pictures and videos in DSLR cameras <br>
        A type of non-standard SD card would be the older XD (extreme digital) picture card <br>
        Proprietary in Olympus and Fujifilm cameras <br>
    </p>

    <h2> eMMC Memory </h2>
    <p>
        This kind of memory is what you would typically find inside smart phones and tablets <br>
    </p>

    <h2> Hot Spares and Cold Spares </h2>
    <p>
        Hot - Equipment that can be swapped out without the need of turning off the power <br>
        Cold - Power must be turned off before replacing the piece of equipment <br> 
    </p>
