    <h2> Ram Slots </h2>
    <p>
        Ram is installed on the motherboard in memory slots <br>
        The average motherboard will have between 2 and 4 memory slots <br>
    </p>

    <h3> RAM DIMM </h3>
    <p>
        DIMM: Dual inline memory module <br>
        Can have 168, 184, or 240 pins <br>
        Has 2 independent rows of pins - 1 row per side <br>
        Has a 64 bit data path <br>
    </p>

    <h3> RAM SIMM </h3>
    <p>
        SIMM: Single inline memory module <br>
        Older technology <br>
        Has redundant pins on both sides <br>
        Will have either 32 or 72 pins <br>
    </p>

    <h3> RAM RIMM </h3>
    <p>
        RIMM: Rambus inline memory module <br>
        Developed by Rambus Inc <br>
        Has 184 pins and resembles a DIMM <br>
        In 1999 RIMM was a breakthrough in memory speed <br>
        Never fully caught on because of the advancement in technology in DIMMs <br>
    </p>

    <h3> RAM Bit vs Byte </h3>
    <p>
        The term 32 or 64 bit data path refers to the number of bits of data that are transferred in 1 cycle <br>
        Bit - the smallest form of data that the computer reads <br>
        8 bits = 1 byte <br>
        DIMM (64 bit) --> 64 / 8 = 8 byte wide bus <br>
        SIMM (32 bit) --> 32 / 8 = 4 byte wide bus <br> 
    </p>
