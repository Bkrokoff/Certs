    <h2> Motherboard Form Factor </h2>
    <p>
        Motherboard - Main component of a computer <br>
        A large circuit board where all the computer components connect to: <br>
        Processor socket - where the CPU is placed <br>
        Memory Slots - where the RAM goes <br>
        Bus slots - used to install various components to add more capabilties to the computer such as video card, sound card, network card, etc <br>
    </p>

    <h2> Form Factor (Motherboards) </h2>
    <p>
        ATX (Advanced Technology Extended) is the most common form factor motherboard used in PCs today <br>
        The de facto standard form factor for PCs today <br>
        ATX motherboard are 12 inches by 9.6 inches <br><br>

        AT was the form factor that was used in the 1980s that was developed by IBM <br>
        AT motherboards are 12 inches by 13.8 inches in size <br>
        No longer in development <br><br>

        Micro ATX boards are smaller than ATX boards <br>
        9.6 inches by 9.6 inches <br>
        Designed to fit in smaller computer cases and is cheaper. Fewer fatures and less power than standard ATX board <br><br>

        BTX form factor was designed by intel to make further improvements from the ATX <br>
        Improved board design, which creates a more in line air flow <br>
        Flexible enough to work both in large and small cases <br><br>

        ITX was designed for smaller, space saving computers <br>
        Consume less power and are cooled by the use of heat sinks (no fans) <br>
        Designed by VIA technologies <br>
        Mini - ITX | Nano - ITX | Pico - ITX | Mobile - ITX (6cm x 6cm) <br><br>

        NLX was created by Intel and it was designed for low-end / low profile computers <br>
        Utilizes a riser card <br>
        Expansion cards can plug in parallel with the motherboard <br>
