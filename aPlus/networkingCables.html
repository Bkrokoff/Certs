    <h2> Networking Cables & Connectors </h2>

    <h3>RJ-11 Connector</h3>
    <p>
        The RJ-11 (registered jack) is a telephone jack <br>
        Used to connect to modems on computers <br>
        Has a hinged locking tab that locks itself in place <br>
        Resembles the RJ-45 but is smaller <br>
    </p>

    <h3> RJ-45 Connector </h3>
    <p>
        Most common network connector <br>
        Used with twisted pair cabling <br>
        Used to attach network interface cards to hubs or switches <br>
        Resembles the RJ-11 but is larger <br>
    </p>

    <h3> BNC Connector </h3>
    <p>
        Common type of RF connector <br>
        Bayonet Neill-Concelman <br>
        Used for both analog and digital video as well as audio <br>
    </p>

    <h3> F-Type Connector </h3>
    <p>
        A screw on connector used on coaxial cables <br>
        Used today primarily to cable providers to attach to cable modems <br>
        Hand tightens by an attached nut <br>
    </p>

    <h3> IEEE 1394 Firewire </h3>
    <p>
        Recognized by its "D" shape <br>
        Commonly associated with attaching peripheral devices, such as digital cameras and printers than network connections <br>
        Found on many types of video and multimedia devices <br>
    </p>

    <h3> USB (Universal Serial Bus) </h3>
    <p>
        Very common on desktops and laptops <br>
        Just about every kind of peripheral connects to a computer using a USB connection <br>
        Examples: Type A, Type B, Mini, Micro <br>
    </p>

    <h3> Thunderbolt Connector </h3>
    <p>
        High speed technology interface that outputs one serial signal from a combination of PCI express and the display port <br>
        Released in 2011 <br>
        Mainly used in Apple products <br>
        Version 1 & 2 uses mini display port | Version 3 uses USB type-C <br>
    </p>

    <h3> RCA Connector </h3>
    <p>
        Older connector produced in 1940s <br>
        Primarily used to carry video and audio signals <br>
        Red - Audio | White - Audio | Yellow - Video <br> 
    </p>

    <h3> ST Connector </h3>
    <p>
        Fiber optic cable connector <br>
        Uses a half-twist bayonet type of lock <br>
        Commonly used with single-mode fiber optic cable <br>
    </p>

    <h3> LC Connector </h3>
    <p>
        The LC (Local Connector) is a fiber optic connector <br>
        Jack is similar to the RJ-45 style <br>
        Commonly used between floors on a building <br>
    </p>

    <h3> SC Connector </h3>
    <p>
        The SC (Standard Connector) is a fiber optic cable connector <br>
        Uses a push-pull connector similar to audio and video plugs <br>
        Commonly used between floors on a building <br>
    </p>

    <h3> Plenum vs Non-Plenum Cables </h3>
    <p>
    Plenum spaces means open air-flow <br>
    Non-plenum spaces means they use air ducts <br>
    Therefore plenum spaces are more prone to fires, so plenum cables must meet certain requirements <br><br>

    Plenum Cables <br>
    Must not produce toxic fumes if they are burned <br>
    </p>

    <h3> Ethernet over powerline </h3>
    <p>
        Sometimes there might be cases in your home or office where you wanted a certain computer in a certain part of the building, to be able to access the internet or to be networked <br>
        And for whatever reason, network cabling or wifi wasnt an option in that part of the building <br>
        Ethernet over power line gives this ability of ethernet networking over power <br>
        Powerline Network Adapter - One plugs into the wall near the computer and one plugs in near the modem - They connect via the power lines <br>
