    <h2>Monitor</h2>
    <p>
        A computer monitor is the primary output component of a computer <br>
        Connects to the computers video adapter through a monitor cable and displays the images on the screen <br>
        A monitor may have a VGA, DVI, HDMI, or a DisplayPort <br> 
    </p>

    <h2>CRT Monitor</h2>
    <p>
        CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) was the technology first used in tv sets <br>
        Uses 3 color electron guns (red, blue, green) <br>
        Constantly redrawing the image on the screen <br>
        These guns sweep across the face of the monitor many times per second, known as the REFRESH RATE <br>
        A refresh rate of 60 hz = redraws the image 60 times per second <br> <br>

        Inside a CRT monitor is a metal plate called a shadow mask <br>
        Shadow mask can pick up outside external magnetic fields which cause discoloration <br>
        DEGAUSSING is the process of getting rid of the unwanted magnetic fields <br>
    </p>

    <h2>LCD Monitor</h2>
    <p>
        LCD (liquid Crystal Display) monitor, also known as flat panel displays <br>
        Produce an image on a flat surface by using liquid crystals <br>
        Light shines through these crystals to produce an image on the screen <br>

        They are lighter, thinner, use less power, and take up less space than CRT monitors <br>
        TFT (Thin Film Transistor) is used to create a higher image quality <br>
        Each pixel on the screen has its own transistor <br>
    </p>

    <h3>Two Types of LCD Monitors: TN vs IPS</h3>
    <p>
        <h4>Twisted Nematic</h4>
        Liquid Crystals twist the light as it comes through <br>
        Older and cheaper technology <br>
        Colors and viewing angles are not as good as modern LCDs <br>
        <h4>In-Plane Switching</h4>
        Liquid crystals stay in place and are aligned in parallel with the glass <br>
        Uses more trnasistors and consumes more power <br>
        Better color reproduction and viewing angles <br>
    </p>

    <h3>LCD Monitor Light Sources: Fluorescent vs LED</h3>
    <p>
        <h4>Fluorescent</h4>
        Uses fluorescent lamps for backlighting <br>
        Emits ultraviolet light when the mercury vapor inside the lamp is ionized <br>
        <h4>LED</h4>
        Uses multiple LEDs (light emitting diodes) arranged in a pattern <br>
        Modern and newer form of backlighting <br> <br>
        Both of these are considered LCD monitors, but LCD that uses LED backlighting is considered an LED monitor <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Resolution</h2>
    <p>
        Resolution is defined as the number of pixels that are used to display an image on the screen <br>
        For example: 1280 x 720 = 921600 pixels being used <br>
        The higher the resolution, the higher the number of pixels being used <br>
        LCDs produce their best quality image when they are set to their highest resolution, which is called their NATIVE RESOLUTION <br> <br>

        Resolutions are given different names for identity purposes: <br>
        XGA (extended graphics array) 1028 x 768 <br>
        SXGA (super extended graphics array) 1280 x 1024 <br>
        SXGA+ (super extended graphics array plus) 1400 x 1050 <br>
        UXGA (ultra extended graphics array) 1600 x 1200 <br>
        WUXGA (wide-screen ultra extended graphics array) 1920 x 1200 <br><br>

        The CONTRAST RATIO refers to the contrast between black and white <br>
        The higher the contrast, the better the display <br>
