    <h2> Bus Slots </h2>
    <p>
        All motherboards are equipped with input / output bus slots <br>
        Typically located at the bottom rear of the motherboard <br>
        Also called expansion slots because they expand the capabalities of the computer <br><br>

        PCI - Peripheral Component Interconnect <br>
        Modern bus type <br>
        Developed in 1993 <br>
        32 or 64 bit path <br>
        Running between 133 - 155 Mb/s <br><br>
        
        AGP - Accelerated Graphics Port <br>
        Created to assist in accelerating 3d computer graphics <br>
        Faster than standard PCI <br>
        Has its own dedicated pathway to the processor <br>
        Only used for a video card <br>
        It is usually brown <br><br>

        PCI Express <br>
        Latest version of bus slots <br>
        Faster than PCI <br>
        Running up to 4 GB/s <br>
        Transfers data in serial <br>
        Designed to succeed all other bus slots <br>
        Not backward compatible <br><br>

        PCIe x1 <br>
        Has 1 lane for data <br>
        A lane has 4 wires. 2 are for sending and 2 are for receiving <br><br>

        PCIe x4 <br>
        Has 4 lane for data <br><br>

        PCIe x8 <br>
        Has 8 lane for data <br><br>

        PCIe x16 <br>
        Has 16 lane for data <br>
        Has succeeded the AGP slot for the video card <br><br>

        PCI-X <br>
        X stands for Extended <br>
        An extension of the old standard PCI slot <br>
        Almost the length of the standard PCI slot <br>
        64 bit bus <br>
        Is backwards compatible with standard PCI <br><br>

        miniPCI <br>
        Used in laptops <br>
        Approx 1/4 the length of a standard PCI slot <br>
        You can insert a regular PCI card into a miniPCI slot, but you have to use a miniPCI to PCI converter <br>
        32 bit, 33 MHz bus <br>

    <h3> Front Panel (Motherboard Connector)</h3>
    <p> 
        Section where you would plug in wires that connect to items that are in the front bezel of the computer case <br>
        PWR (power) connector - Turns the computer on/off <br>
        PLED (Power LED) connector - Indicates when the computer is on/off or in standby mode <br>
        HD_LED (Hard Drive LED) - Indicates when there is hard drive activity <br>
        Reset switch - Restarts the computer by doing a hard boot <br>
        Speaker connector - Used to plug in the internal speaker of the computer <br>    
    </p>

    <h3> Front / Top Panel Connections </h3>
    <p>
        Front USB ports <br>
        Front audio ports (Headphones or speakers, Microhpone) <br>
        Power button <br>
        Reset button <br>
        Drive activity light (When the hard drive is being acessed) <br>
