    <h2> RAID </h2>
    <h3> Storage (Fault Tolerance)</h3>
    <p>
        Storage is another very important part of fault tolerance <br>
        Data loss prevention <br>
        RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) - Data is copied to multiple disks <br>
    </p>
    
    <h3> Types of RAID </h3>
    <h4> Raid 0 (Striping) </h4>
    <p>
        Not fault tolerant <br>
        Data is not duplicated, it is "striped" (spread) across multiple disks <br>
        Advantage is speed <br>
    </p>

    <h4> Raid 1 (Mirroring & Duplexing) </h4>
    <p>
        Is fault tolerant <br>
        Data is copied on more than one disk <br>
    </p>

    <h4> Raid 5 (Striping with Parity) </h4>
    <p>
        Requires 3 or more disks <br>
        Data is "striped" (spread) across multiple disks along with parity <br>
        The equivalent of an entire disk is used to store parity <br>
        Example: An array of 4 disks totaling 4 terabytes, only 3 terabytes will be used for actual data storage <br>
    </p>

    <h4> Raid 10 </h4>
    <p>
        Combines RAID 1 with RAID 0 <br>
        Minimum of 4 disks <br>
        Benefits from the fault tolerance of RAID 1 and the speed of RAID 0 <br>
        Can only use 50% of capacity for data storage <br>
