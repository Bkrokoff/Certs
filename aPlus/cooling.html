    <h2> Cooling </h2>
    <p>
        Cooling is very important to a computer <br>
        Computers generate a lot of heat <br>
        If the components are not adequately cooled the computer will: run slow, lock up, shut down, shorten the life of the computer <br>
        2 of the biggest heat generators come from the CPU and video card <br>
    </p>

    <h3> Case Fans </h3>
    <p>
        Primary way of cooling <br>
        Intake fan - Brings air from outside the case into the case <br>
        Exhaust Fan - Pushes air outside the case <br>
        This known as ACTIVE COOLING <br>
    </p>

    <h3> Heat Sink (CPU) </h3>
    <p>
        A heat sink is an aluminum block with fins that directly make contact with the CPU <br>
        Its purpose is to increase the surface area of the CPU so that it can make more air contact for cooling <br>
        The fins on the heat sink are designed to further increase the surface area for air circulation <br>
        Once the heat sink makes contact, the heat will transfer from the CPU to the heat sink <br>
    </p>

    <h4>Thermal Compound</h4>
    <p>
        Used to fill in the microscopic air gaps between the heat sink and the CPU <br>
    </p>

    <h3> Water Cooling</h3>
    <p>
        Water cooling is better than air cooling <br>
        They are quieter, but more expensive <br>
        Use a pump of constantly circulating water <br>
