    <h3> CPU Socket</h3>
    <p>
        The processor socket is the place on the motherboard where the CPU is placed <br>
        Its a square plastic or metal holder with multiple holes <br>
        Provides physical and electrical contact between the motherboard and the CPU <br><br>

        A modern CPU socket is called a ZIF - Zero Insertion Force <br>
        This means the CPU is installed on the socket with no force <br>
        There are several different types of CPU socket designs called "packages" <br>
        
    </p>

    <h4> Socket Packages </h4>
    <p>
        PGA - Pin Grade Array <br>
        PGA is a typical square ZIF socket design with holes and a lock down lever <br><br>

        LGA - Land Grid Array <br>
        It's a metal casing with a door that closes over the CPU <br>
        Has pins that make contact with the bottom of the processor <br>
        The socket has pins, while the LGA circuit has pads <br>
    </p>

    <h3>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h3>
    <p>
        The main component on the motherboard <br>
        The brain of the computer where all the data processing takes place <br>
        Its the largest component on the motherboard <br><br>

        The speed of the CPU is measured in MHz <br>
        1 Mhz = 1 million cycles per second <br>
        500 Mhz = 500 million cycles per second <br>
        1 Ghz = 1 billion cycles per second <br>
        3 Ghz = 3 billion cycles per second <br><br>
    </p>

    <h4> Inside the Processor</h4>
    <p>
        CPU core - Where the reading and execution of instructions takes place <br>
        Single core - Processes instructions one at a time <br>
        Multi core - Able to process multiple things at once (Dual core - 2 cores | Quad core - 4 cores) <br>
    </p>

    <h4> CPU Manufacturers </h4>
    <p>
        Intel <br>
        The largest manufacturer of processors <br>
        Founded in the late 60s <br>
        Dominated the CPU market <br>
        Examples: 286, 386, 486, Celeron, and Pentium <br><br>

        AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) <br>
        2nd largest manufacturer of processors <br>
        Founded in the late 60s <br>
        Examples: K5, K6, Athlon, Duron, Sempron, Athlon 64, Opteron, Phenom <br>

    </p>

    <h3> 32 bit vs 64 bit</h3>
    <p>
        CPUs come in 32 or 64 bit version <br>
        The difference is the way it handles memory <br>
        32 bit - 2^32 bytes of memory = 4 GB <br>
        64 bit - 2^64 bytes of memory = 16 Exabytes <br>
    </p>

    <h3> Memory Cache </h3>
    <p>
        Made of SRAM (Static RAM) - very fast memory <br>
        The processors internal memory <br>
        Holds data and instructions waiting to be used by the processor <br>
        Processor will check memory cache first before RAm since it is faster <br><br>

        Level 1 Cache - Primary Cache <br>
        Located on the processor <br>
        Very fast - fastest memory cache on the computer <br><br>

        Level 2 cache - External Cache <br>
        Used to catch recent data accesses from the processor that were not caught by the level 1 cache <br>
        Generally located on a separate chip on the motherboard <br>
        Larger than level 1 cache, but it's not as fast as level 1 cache <br>
    </p>

    <h3> Chipset </h3>
    <p>
        A chipset is a smaller set of chips that has replaced a larger amount of chips <br>
        Its job is to control data flow between the CPU, peripherals, bus slots, and memory <br><br>

        North Bridge <br>
        Its on the north side of the motherboard and acts as the middleman between the CPU, memory, and PCI-E/AGP <br><br>

        South Bridge <br>
        Its on the south side of the motherboard and connects to the PCI slots, USB slots, SATA and IDE connectors <br><br>

        In order for the CPU to communicate with the south side of the board (PCI slots, USB slots, SATA and IDE connectors) it has to go through the north bridge, then the south bridge <br>
        The north brige is faster than the south bridge <br>
        Higher speed components (CPU, memory, and PCI-E/AGP) are connected to the north bridge and lower speed components (PCI slots, USB slots, SATA and IDE connectors) are connected to the south bridge <br><br>

        Bridges connect to various parts of the motherboard using pathways called a BUS <br>
        BUS - A pathway or set of pathways that allows data and signals to travel between components on the motherboard <br>
        66 Mhz bus - Sends data at 66 million cycles per second <br>
        The higher the bus speed, the faster the computer can perform <br>
        Front side bus - the connection between the CPU and the northbridge chipset <br>
