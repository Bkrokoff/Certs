    <h2> Default Gateway</h2>
    <p>
        A default gateway is a device that forwards data from one network to another <br>
        A majority of the time this is going to be a router <br><br>

        A default gateway lets devices from one network communicate with devices on another network <br>
        "Default" means that the designated device is the first option that's looked upon when data needs to exit the network <br> 
    </p>

    <p>
        If the computers on the left-hand side wanted to communicate with each other, they would communicate through the switch <br>
        They can do this because they are all on the same network - The data does not have to exit the network and go through the default gateway<br>
    </p>

    <h3> How do computers know if another computer is on their own network or on a different network? </h3>
    <p>
        This involves <a href="./ipAddresses.html"> IP addresses</a> and subnets <br><br>

        192.168.0.2 <br>
        An IP address consists of two parts - A network address and a host address <br><br>

        255.255.255.0
        A subnet mask reveals how many bits in the IP address are used for the network by masking the network portion of the IP address <br>

    <p>
        Since the computers are on different networks - the computer will send out an <a href="./arp.html"> ARP</a> broadcast and ask for the <a href="./macAddress.html">MAC address</a> of the default gateway and not the mac address of the computer <br>
