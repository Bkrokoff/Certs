    <h2>Hub, Switch, and Router</h2>

    <h3>Hub</h3>

    <p>

    The purpose of a hub is to connect all your network devices together on an internal network <br><br>

    It is a device that has multiple ports that accepts ethernet connection from network devices <br><br>

    Does not filter data or know where it is supposed to be sent - the only thing a hub knows is when a device is connected to one of its ports <br><br>

    When a data packet arrives at one of the ports, it is copied to all the other ports, so all the devices on that hub sees the data packets - Creates security concerns and unnecessary traffic on the network <br><br>

    </p>

    <h3>Switch</h3>

    <p>

    A device that has multiple ports that accepts ethernet connections from network devices <br><br>

    Unlike a hub, a switch is intelligent, it can learn the MAC addresses of devices connected to it and store the physical addresses in its table <br><br>

    When a data packet is sent to a switch its only directed to the intended destination port, unlike  a hub that will just rebroadcast the data to every port <br><br>

    Switches are preferred to hubs because they reduce any unnecessary traffic on the network <br><br>

    </p>

    <h3>Hubs and Switches</h3>

    <p>

    Hubs and switches are used to exchange data within a local area network <br><br>

    Not used to exchange data outside their own network <br>
    In order to exchange or route data outside a network, a device needs to be able to read IP addresses <br><br>

    Hubs and switches do no read IP addresses, so this is where we use routers <br><br>

    </p>

    <h3>Router</h3>

    <p>

    A router is a device that routes or forwards data from one network to another based on their IP addresses <br><br>

    When a data packet is received from the router, the router inspects the data's IP address and determines if the packet was meant for another network <br>
    If the router determines that the data packet is meant for its own network, it receives it - but if its not meant for its own network, it sends it off to another network <br><br>

    A router is essentially the gateway of a network <br><br>

    Hubs and switches are used to create networks <br>
    Routers are used to connect networks <br><br>
